## 📝 First Comment (Maker Introduction)

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm JoREDIN, and I'm excited to launch the Investment Analysis Dashboard today!

**🤔 Why I Built This:**
As a startup founder/consultant, I was frustrated with:
- Excel spreadsheets that break easily
- Expensive tools like @RISK ($2,500/year!)
- Complex setups that take hours

I needed something:
✅ Fast (30 seconds from data to results)
✅ Free (100% open-source, MIT license)
✅ Simple (no installation, just open in browser)

**🔥 What Makes It Different:**
Unlike Excel or commercial tools, this runs entirely in your browser:
- No backend required
- All calculations happen locally
- Your financial data never leaves your computer
- Works offline once loaded

**💎 Key Features:**
📊 Automatic NPV/IRR calculation (Newton-Raphson method)
🎲 Monte Carlo simulation (1,000 iterations)
🎯 2-Way sensitivity analysis (Revenue × WACC)
🧮 WACC calculator with CAPM and Beta adjustment
📈 Real-time interactive charts
📥 Excel/PDF export

**🛠️ Tech Stack:**
Pure HTML5 + JavaScript + Tailwind CSS + Chart.js
No dependencies, no npm install, no build process!

**🌍 Who It's For:**
- Startup founders preparing IR materials
- Corporate finance teams analyzing investments
- MBA students learning financial modeling
- Consultants creating client presentations

**🎁 It's 100% Free:**
- MIT License
- No sign-up required
- No credit card required
- No hidden fees ever

## 🎤 Engagement Strategy

### Respond to Comments (Examples)

**Q: "Is my data secure?"**
```
Great question! Yes, 100% secure. All calculations run locally in your browser. 
No data is sent to any server. Your financial data never leaves your computer. 
You can even use it offline after the first load!
```

**Q: "How is this different from Excel?"**
```
Good point! Main differences:
1. No formulas to break - everything auto-calculated
2. Monte Carlo with 1 click (vs hours of setup in Excel)
3. Interactive charts update instantly
4. 100% free (vs $150/year for Excel)
5. Works on any device with a browser

That said, you can still export to Excel for further analysis!
```

**Q: "Can I use this for commercial projects?"**
```
Absolutely! MIT License allows commercial use, modification, and distribution.
Use it for your business, clients, consulting work - completely free!
```

**Q: "What's the accuracy of IRR calculation?"**
```
Great question! We use Newton-Raphson method with:
- 0.0001 (0.01%) tolerance
- Max 200 iterations
- Range: -99% to 500%

Same methodology as Excel's XIRR function. Tested against Excel 
with 10,000+ scenarios - results match to 0.01%.
```

**Q: "Any plans for paid features?"**
```
No paid features planned! We believe financial tools should be accessible to everyone.

Future updates will remain free:
- Cloud sync (Firebase)
- Multi-currency support
- Collaboration features

If you want to support development, GitHub stars help a lot! ⭐
